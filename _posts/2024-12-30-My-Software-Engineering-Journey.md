title: My Journey into Software Engineering
subtitle: Learn about my Software Engineering Journey
---

From an early age, I found solace in the realms of mathematics and science, my preferred subjects throughout my school years. With this passion, I pursued a college degree in mathematics, intending to leverage my skills as a financial advisor. However, unforeseen challenges blurred that vision, leaving me disheartened and in search of a fulfilling career.  

Determined to stay within the math and science domain, I sought a path that allowed self-teaching, provided access to assistance, and allowed entry into the industry without the need for a bachelor's degree. This quest led me to the world of disciplined software engineering.  

Had you told my high school self that I would become a software engineer, I would have dismissed it as absurd. Back then, I was unaware that software was a distinct field, having only discovered it through diligent research. My choice of software engineering stemmed from recognizing that mathematics is a subset of software, intertwined with creativity. It coalesces two disciplines I cherished as a child into a single, fulfilling pursuit.  

In my independent journey of honing engineering skills, I've found greater freedom and enjoyment as a developer than I could have imagined in the role of a financial analyst. The excitement of delving into documentation, applying newfound knowledge to captivating projects, and witnessing tangible results resonates deeply with me.  

Choosing this field was not just about personal enjoyment but about recognizing my potential for excellence. The dynamic fast-paced nature of software engineering, coupled with collaboration and continuous learning, ensures perpetual growth. This field never stagnates, offering a perpetual stream of opportunities to learn, create, and build qualities that align perfectly with my love for creativity and construction.  

I take pride in being a software engineer, grateful for the path I've chosen. My journey has been a rich learning experience, and while I've accomplished much, there's still a vast landscape of knowledge and mastery to explore. I embrace the ongoing adventure with enthusiasm, knowing that my decision was the right one for me.
