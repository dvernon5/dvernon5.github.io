subtitle: A Software Engineer in the Making
---

Hello, my name is Donovan Vernon, and I am a person who's passionate about adventure and a challenge. That was my reasoning and drive for becoming a software engineer. I love the thrill of learning continuously, new technology, and disciplines. I love solving complex problems that require me to think inside/outside of the box and get me outside of my comfort zone. Most importantly, being able to collaborate with like-minded individuals, and being able to create renowned technology and an everlasting friendship with my peers.

Beyond engineering, I'm an avid sports enthusiast, finding joy in basketball, tennis, and hiking. These activities mirror my teamwork mentality and my willingness to tackle challenges head-on. Exploring new locations, trying different cuisines, and meeting diverse individuals are passions that align with my curiosity-driven nature.  

I am looking forward to the opportunity of meeting and working with y'all.
